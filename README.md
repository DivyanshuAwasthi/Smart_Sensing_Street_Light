This arduino project explain about smart street light system using IR sensors and LDR.
Light Detecting Resistor is useful to detect light or darkness as its resistance is varying according to the light intensity. I have used IR sensor to detect the vehicle so that Light will be turn ON only if there is a night and vehicle is present at IR sensor.
